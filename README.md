# blackjack

This is a simple concurrent program written in Go Programming Language that plays a game of blackjack.

NOTE: Unfortunately, it is made so that it relies upon a package called "CS221" (the name of my class). This package helps to create connections to servers and must be in a specific file location within your PATH for Go. This code is therefore not runnable, but can be looked over to see functionality and programming concepts used.
